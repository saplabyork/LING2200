#  The myoelastic/aerodynamic theory of phonation 
[Ch.5](ch5-Phonation.pdf)

In our last lecture we noted the complexities involved in the movement of [vocal folds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn12x2SJrNM) given the highly variable nature of their composition as well as their elongation and position governed by muscular control of the arytenoids and associated muscles. 
The most widely accepted theory explaining the nature of vocal fold vibration or oscillation is called the **myoelastic** theory, which explains oscillation as the interaction between muscle forces (*myo-*), tissue elasticity, and air pressure flow. 

The myoelastic/aerodynamic theory of phonation was first described by the Dutch speech scientist [van den Berg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janwillem_van_den_Berg) in 1958. It basically states that vocal folds open up due to sub-glottal pressure and close due to elastic and aerodynamic pressures. But that's too simplistic. Here are the specific steps:

1. Muscular activity causes the arytenoids to rotate causing the vocal processes come together thereby positioning the vocal folds close together (adduction)

2. Sub-glottal pressure (air pressure below the vocal folds) increases until the vocal folds are forced apart.

3. With narrow opening of the vocal folds (being pushed apart by the sub-glottal air pressure) escaping air travels fast (this is called the *Venturi tube effect*). The fast moving air through the narrow passage causes a momentary decrease in air pressure across the opening (this is called the **Bernoulli effect**)

4. The decrease in pressure across the folds causes the folds to be sucked together (this is part of the Bernoulli effect you might be familiar with, it's the reason why when you're in the shower the curtain might be sucked in toward you or *lift* of airplane wings)

5. The Bernoulli effect AND the myoelastic recoil forces of the vocal folds themselves cause adduction

6. When fully adducted the process begins all over again with an increases in sub-glottal pressure. The process repeats resulting in phonation!

In the image below, notice that inferior ("lower lip" in the picture) and superior ("upper lip") aspects of the vocal folds adduct at different times. Initially the inferior aspect abducts and ultimately the superior aspect. Similarly, during abduction, the inferior aspect closes before the superior aspect.

# One-mass model

The **One-mass model of phonation** extends the basics of the myoelastics theory of phonation but considering each vocal fold as a single mass that moves in a uniform manner. The real difference between the myoelastic model and the one-mass model is that the one-mass model says that the fast moving air above the vocal folds continues to move fast as it gets further from the glottis due to *intertia*. The fast moving air in the oral cavity leaves and area of low pressure just above the glottis. The high pressure air from the lungs forces the walls of the closure further apart because there is a mass of low pressure above it.

So basically, the elastic and Bernoulli forces drive the vocal folds together, and both subglottal high pressure and supra-glottal low pressure drive the vocal folds apart.

These models are good but probably pale in comparison to the actual dynamics of the vocal fold separation, especially with respect to the different aspects of the vocal folds moving at different times. People who *really* study vocal fold dynamics often use 16-mass models to describe its movement!

## Phonation Threshold

Just how much sub-glottal pressure is required to pop open the adducted vocal folds? The minimum pressure required is called the **phonation threshold pressure** (PTP). The PTP varies proportionally with F~0~. With increasing F~0~ so is PTP. For example, for low F~0~s PTP can be around 3cm H~2~0 and up to around 6cm H~2~0 at higher F~0~s.  

# Spectrum

Phonation is the oscillation of the vocal folds back and forth, in a roughly periodic fashion. Like all of our discussion of complex periodic waves (like the complex wave resulting from plucking a string or blowing into a flute), there is a fundamental oscillation, and an infinite number of harmonics at frequencies systematically related to the fundamental. The resulting **spectrum**, in idealized form, would look like the line spectra seen in earlier lectures. 

The spectrum of harmonics produced by the oscillating vocal folds is called the **glottal spectrum**, which is unique for how the amplitude characteristics diminish with increasing frequency. This diminishing of amplitude is called the **spectral slope**.

\

The glottal spectrum has to be inferred from the sound coming out of a mouth, that is, we never get to hear exactly the sound of the vocal folds oscillating. When we synthesize the source spectrum, it often sounds like [blowing rasberries](sounds/sourcespec.wav), that is, it lacks the "shape" of a vowel sound, which is the filtered glottal spectrum through the oral and nasal cavities. The harmonic content of the glottal spectrum theoretically decreases by **12dB per octave**. What's an *octave*? The name reveals that it has to do with '8', or the eight musical notes that occupy the interval between a particular frequency and twice that frequency. So an octave higher than 220Hz will be 440Hz, and likewise, an octave below would be 110Hz. So, for the glottal spectrum, the harmonic that is twice the fundamental will have an amplitude 12dB less than the fundamental. 

If the first harmonic (F0) is 200Hz with an amplitude of 36dB, the harmonic at 400Hz (H2) will have an amplitude of 24dB. The harmonic with 800Hz (H4) will have an amplitude of 12dB, the harmonic at 1600Hz (H8) will have an amplitude of 0dB.

Do you want to synthesize a glottal spectrum in Praat? Here is a good [tutorial](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Source-filter_synthesis_1__Creating_a_source_from_pitch.html).

## Harmonic spacing

When the vocal folds elongate, via tilting the thyroid cartilage, so too does the **harmonic spacing** of the spectrum. Remember that the harmonics of a complex periodic wave are whole number multiples of the fundamental. So a 100Hz fundamental will have tighter spaced harmonics (100Hz), than a 200Hz fundamental. The spacing of the harmonics contribute to the timbre of the sound. This explains why kids sound different from adults, and not just higher pitched. 
 
# Periodicity in the human voice

The vocal folds do not vibrate in a completely periodic manner (like our pure tones generated in Praat), rather there are always small fluctuations in their movement resulting in shifting frequency and amplitudes. Even if you tried very hard, it would be impossible to maintain a steady F0 when sustaining a sung note. Try it out. Record yourself singing "aaaahhh" in Praat and examine the F0. Here's [mine](sounds/aaah.wav). Below are the waveforms from the 1st half of the sustained vowel:

\

And the 2nd half of the vowel:

  <img src="images/aaah_2nd.png">
</p>
\

Can you calculate the difference in F0?

## Variability in F0

Because the vocal fold oscillation is close to being periodic, but not quite, we have come up with ways to describe variation in F0. If there is variability in the *timing* between cycles of oscillation it is called *jitter*. If there is variability in the *amplitude* of the cycles, it is called *shimmer*. Jitter and shimmer reveal a lot about the speaker. They are called "indexical" characteristics of the speaker and help the listener identify who is speaking because we all have inherent variability in our F0.

## The Quality of Voices

It’s rare that someone cannot tell a piano from an acoustic guitar even if they’re playing the exact same note, that is, we’re so familiar with how a piano and guitar sound that they’re identifiable with just one note. Similarly, we are so accustomed to how voices sound that we can tell them apart instantly (more or less) especially if we’re familiar with them—how often do you confuse the voice of your friend with the voice of your mom? 

Even if the fundamental frequency of two voices were the same, the spectral characteristics of the two voices would differ because of the size and shape of the two speakers' vocal tracts. The differences in oral cavity contribute to the vocal signature of individuals.

### Vocal tract length

For example, vocal tract lengths (from glottis to lips) of males and females are quite similar up until around age 8 (around 13cm), when they start to diverge. By age 20, they differ by about 2cm, with males vocal tract lengths around 17.5cm and females around 15.5cm on average

If the vocal tract is modeled like a tube that’s closed at the glottis end and open at the lips, we can calculate its resonances and the areas of the spectrum that are amplified.  

For the average male vocal tract (17.5cm): F1 = v/4L = 343 m/s / 4(17.5) = 1500 Hz \
For the average male vocal tract (15.5cm): F1 = v/4L = 343 m/s / 4(15.5) = 1330 Hz \

### How vocal folds vibrate

Voice quality can also reflect the ways vocal folds vibrate in an individual. When vocal folds are taut, causing them to be pressed when adducted, Psub must be high in order overcome the tension to initiate phonation. This hyperadduction is often described as harsh or tense. The opposite hyperadduction is hypoadduction, which results from vocal folds not fully adducting. 

With the loose tension of the *hypoadducted* vocal folds, the Psub does not find much resistance to begin phonation. The *hypoadducted* vocal folds might allow air to escape without being converted to acoustic energy. The loose tension can create a narrow channel between the vocal folds adding turbulent noise to the glottal spectrum. The hypoadducted voice is often described as breathy or hoarse.  

### Vibration variation

Vocal folds, like any tissue, are not uniform in thickness, density, elasticity, etc., like an engineered plastic or metal, and so they’re subject to variability in their movement. Small fluctuations in their movement results in variation in frequency and amplitude of the acoustic energy being produced by their vibration.

1. **Jitter**: variation in frequency of vocal fold oscillation
2. **Shimmer**: variation in amplitude of oscillation

Both Jitter and Shimmer contribute to our vocal signature.

# Register

Phonation comes in a variety of colors. Think about the voices you encounter on a daily basis: a podcaster's vocal fry, falsetto of a singer, screaming of a child, etc. These various styles of phonation are called **register**. Different registers require different volume velocities of air and subglottal pressures to start the vocal folds vibrating.

1. Pulsed register: The lowest fundamental frequencies produced by speakers is variously called pulsed voice, creaky voice, and more popularly called “vocal fry” or “glottal fry”. F0 is around 50Hz and low subglottal pressure is required to initiate phonation

2. Modal voice: Normal voiced phonation with F0 being 100-150Hz for males, and 175-240Hz for females. The vocal folds are shorter in modal phonation relative to other registers, and the entire length of the vocal folds vibrate once air from the lungs has achieved the threshold pressure, which is typically around 7-8 cm H2O. The volume velocity of air required for modal voicing is at least 50cm3/sec, and typically ranges 70-200 cm3/sec. 

3. Whisper: The whisper register does not involve vocal fold vibration, but rather the phonation comes from the noise generated by the high-velocity air flow, around 200300cm3/second.  The volume velocity of air through this relatively small channel results in a flow that is highly turbulent and noisy. Unlike voiced phonation, there is energy across the spectrum, with amplitudes varying from frequency to frequency (aperiodic), which is then filtered by the oral cavity like vowels.  

# Disordered phonation

“Normal” phonation is a rather subjective term, but speech-language pathologists agree on some fundamental aspects of the normally functioning glottis and the acoustic properties of the sounds it produces. Keep in mind that all normal voices have some degree of noise, or aperiodic acoustic energy in the glottal spectrum resulting from obstructions to the airflow. 

Disordered phonation can refer to a host of deviations from normal voice quality, fundamental frequency, or amplitude, but in lay terminology is often captured with descriptions like shrill, raspy, or hoarse, etc. 

A [breathy](https://www.rit.edu/ntid/slpros/assessment/speechvoice/training/7) voice indicates that the vocal folds do not close completely (but they’re close enough to have vibration initiated) and as result, there is continuous air flow through the glottis during vocal fold vibration. Air flow through the narrow channel of the glottis is turbulent and adds noise to the higher frequencies of the glottal spectrum.

A [hoarse](https://www.voicedoctor.net/diagnosis/hoarseness) voice is often the result of irritated or swollen vocal folds, which affect the periodicity of their vibration. Aperiodicity is essentially noise that is added to the periodicity of the vocal fold vibration and in hoarse voices the noise results from a leak of subglottal air through the vocal folds in a section that is not vibrating. 

Why do we get phonation problems? Perhaps you've lost your voice before. It often accompanies some sort of sickness like a cold or the flu which can result in a swelling of larynx that disrupts normal phonation. Infections like this also tend to cause excess mucous production, which then coats the glottis, affecting the periodicity of the vocal fold vibration. But neurological disorders can also affect phonation. 

1. [Parkinsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiGzvQHfYCw): Affects the dopamine (a neurotransmitter molecule that plays an important role in body movement and the feeling of pleasure) production. Phonation may be one of the first signs of Parkinson’s disease appearing before other speech deficits like articulatory and fluency impairments.
- reduced amplitude of voice
- higher F0
- decreased overall range of F0

2. [Spasmodic dysphonia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqzfsKMaLqk): Neurological condition that causes spasms (sudden, involuntary movements) in the muscles of vocal folds. Periods of phonation breaks with a voice that sounds strained or breathy.  Sometimes individuals with this dysphonia have a vocal tremor because of these vocal fold spasms. There are different varieties of this disorder, targeting either the adducting or abducting motions of the vocal folds. Two types of SD: Adductor and Abductor SD.

**Adductor spasmodic dysphonia** is the more common of the two, which causes the vocal folds to snap closed and stiffen, leaving the voice sounding strained. **Abductor spasmodic dysphonia** the vocal folds stay open, which can affect how readily the vocal folds vibrate. Vocal fold vibration is difficult to initiate because of their open position and when they do vibrate the amplitude is reduced. The voice of individuals with abductor spasmodic dysphonia ends up sounding weak and breathy.
